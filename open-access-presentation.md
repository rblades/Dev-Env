<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Good Afternoon. Let’s jump right into this and talk about open access. We will define two terms:</p>
<p><strong>Open source</strong> means sharing and making all the source code files of a project available online. This does not just include code, but notes on process, images, video, audio, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access</strong> means permitting anyone with an internet connection and a link to view, copy, and/or change those files for their own use.</p>
<p>Now the two terms are often used interchangeably. But I want to focus today on open access because it implies accessibility. Today I am going to share my experience as a public historian doing open access work online, tell you all why humanities scholars are bad at open access, critique the utopic idealism of open access and its proposed global accessibility, and problematize the need for humanities scholars to start “doing” into open access (and yes, let’s just say open access is an action phrase that you can “do”).</p>
<p>I originally subtitled this project “My Digital Graveyard” because I wanted to talk to you about the “failure” or at least “dead endedness” of many of my digital projects. I was going to use these projects as a case study. I have several versions of my masters research project that for one reason or another were abandoned for different ideas and ways of presenting history online. But my history of failing at open access begins much earlier. In 2011, for instance, my supervisor Shawn Graham enlisted me to scrape all of Prime Minister Mackenzie King’s diary entries on the Library and Archives site into text files to perform a “distant reading.” We were going to plug these files into the text analysis tool <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>. I began to look at the files and discovered they were all digitized as images. So we could not extract the text directly. Being 2011, we attempted to run the images through free, online OCR (Optical Character Recognition) generators which convert images of text into computer-readable text files. The OCR we used was horrible and the images were not exactly clean. The result was a huge mess of text. We abandoned the project.</p>
<p>I am not going to go into depth on my graveyard anymore. As with any research, from the time I applied for this conference to when I wrote this presentation, my process and thus ideas about open access changed. Instead, I want to begin with a comment from when I was a young digital humanities student in my undergrad. I had the privilege of being a <a href="https://www.hastac.org/about-hastac">HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory)</a> scholar and blog about my research doing digital history work. I received a great comment on my post about the diary failure:</p>

<p>Josh responded to my post with a mantra I remind myself of at least several times a month: there is signal in the noise. On a metaphorical level, so much of open access is noise. But we can draw the signal from the cacophony presented to us online.</p>
<h2 id="historians-are-bad-at-open-access">Historians are bad at Open Access</h2>
<p>I want to get into open access by stating that <strong>historians, and humanities scholars generally, are bad at open access.</strong> We are usually not to keen to share our work in its development phases. I think it mainly stems from a desire to produce original, individual work. Then, on the practical side, historians are not well trained in basic file naming conventions, data structures, and organization. Open access does not necessarily require much technical skill. You can create a blog and publish your material online.</p>
<p>None of this presentation is groundbreaking or new. In fact a lot of this is intuitive. And maybe I will just state some obvious points about open access throughout the presentation. But my goal is to push our critical thinking as humanities scholars from academia to the online world. Historians need to see themselves as entangled in online communities. Because it is easy to assume that “the digital” is some separate world. It is easy for scholars not interacting online to hear the noise of “the digital” and lazily agree with ideas like “open access proliferates knowledge.” But when you really interact with this stuff, you see how far from the truth those repeated scripts are, and how close to home these issues actually are. I will argue that “the digital” reflects a lot of our academic practices. Let’s pull some signal from this noise.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-online-failing-big-as-a-white-male-academic">Transparency online: Failing big as a white, male academic</h2>
<h2 id="open-access-coulda-shoulda">Open access: Coulda, Shoulda</h2>
<p>I will not put forward two statements.</p>
<p><strong>1. Open access cannot be entire accessible.</strong></p>
<p>Theoretically I can make my work entirely open source by providing all the information and data that I desire. But open access is about reproducibility. Both digital literacy as well as access to computers and networks. How can we say the internet is an open bastion of information when globally access is limited by infrastructure and socio-economic positioning. It is both ignorant and arrogant to assume open access is entirely open. Moreover, even if everyone had the potential to see my work, I doubt few people would actually want to. Nor would they see the value in it. Who, then, is my work actually open for? Primarily other historians and researchers. And there is nothing wrong with that fact. We must, however, recognize that any project claiming to be ‘open’ is limited by these complexities. <strong>Just because historical work is made available online does not mean it suddenly becomes more popular.</strong> In this regard, open access reproduces the structures of academia. Essentially, now you get to allow infinitely more people the opportunity to not read your academic work!</p>
<p><strong>2. Open access should not be entirely accessible.</strong></p>
<p>This one might be a bit more obvious. From a practical standpoint, you are not allowed to make certain information available online. If you interview people, you likely have to transcribe and destroy the recordings. We all understand this. So the main point I want to make, then, actually inherits an important method from.</p>
<p>I do not then obviously believe in radical open access. And this is where I believe humanities scholars can do amazing work in open access. Because we understand how to meticulously fashion a narrative. We understand the art of storytelling. As such, we can begin to apply our knowledge towards an <em>art of open access</em>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Open access is an art. Historians can bring their knowledge of the history entangled in open access to understand it. Because as much as the history of open access has largely been driven by a positivist ideology, historians - and humanities scholars broadly - can approach the limitations of open access with their own ideas and solutions. The issue here, however, is an assumption that one’s identity is dissolved in the open embrace of the online world. Because it’s easy for me to stand here as a white, male academic working with a white, male tenured professor and lecture historians on opening their lives up to the online world.</p>
<p>And this is where I want to end because I do not have solutions to these problems. The issues are largely systemic and my intuition is that we need to create safe online communities while also critically engaging with these very uncomfortable issues surrounding open access. I’d much rather hear what you have to say about this. I hope you have plenty of questions and we can have a great</p>
