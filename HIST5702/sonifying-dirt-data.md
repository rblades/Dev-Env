<h1 id="sonifying-dirty-data">Sonifying Dirty Data</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DOmpxuk.png" alt="The plan mapped out"></p>
<p>This project is an attempt to sonify dirty data. So much of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) focuses on, surprise, visuality. Digital Humanists are no strangers to cleaning up dirty data. We see it presented before us on screens. The OCR misses words, or replaces letters with numbers. We then use cleaning methods, regular expressions, and the like to get the text back to its original informational state. We clean away the ‘nonsense’ data that becomes entangled in our ‘pure’ data. But what happens if we sonify that dirty data? Take it a step further: what happens if we then convert that sonification back into a text file? We begin to mix the digital voice into our work. Sound literally changes our data as it becomes entangled in our association of OCR and visuality.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Let’s start from scratch. If you already have your pi running, or are using a preinstalled SD card, you can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>For this tutorial we are going to use the official Raspberry Pi operating system, Raspbian. You can install NOOBS, but all that does is give you a choice between several operating systems.</p>
<p>On the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">downloads page</a> select Raspbian and choose a version to download. If you have an 8GB Micro SD card, stick with Rapsbian Jessie. If you have a much smaller Micro SD card, you might choose Raspbian Jessie Lite since it is a more bare-bones version of Raspbian and thus uses less space. <strong>This tutorial uses Raspbian Jessie 4.1</strong> so use Lite at your own caution (though you should stil be able to download packages and do most of the heavy lifting). Micro SD cards are pretty darn cheap, though, so think about purchasing a larger one if need be.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A Micro SD card is the small little chip. You usually cannot connect a Micro SD directly to your computer. Most Micro SD cards, however, come with an adapter. Plug the Micro SD into the adapter and make sure the little locking mechanism is unlocked (or else you cannot write anything to the card).</p>
<p>Once your image has downloaded, insert your Micro SD card in the adapter to your computer, and follow Raspberry Pi’s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/">documentation on how to mount the image to your Micro SD card</a>. Each platform has its own method. Remember to safely eject the card.</p>
<h3 id="the-screen-isnt-showing-your-pi-and-hdmi">The Screen isn’t Showing! Your Pi and HDMI</h3>
<p>I am devoting an entire sub-section to connecting your pi to a monitor via and HDMI cable because <strong>this can be the most annoying first step for any pi beginner.</strong></p>
<p>Before plugging your pi into the power, plug in your Micro SD card - the gold stripes should face the pi and you will hear a click, locking the Micro SD card in place.</p>
<p>Then turn your monitor on. Wait until it is running. Make sure your HDMI cable is connected to your monitor. <strong>Now</strong> plug in the HDMI cable to your pi. If you do not have a device that supports HDMI, fear not.<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/use-your-desktop-or-laptop-screen-and-keyboard-with-your-pi/"> You can connect you pi to your computer via an ethernet cable</a>. <strong>YOU CANNOT CONNECT YOUR PI TO YOUR COMPUTER VIA HDMI</strong>, since your computer’s HDMI is usually an output, not an input.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your monitor, TV, etc. may have multiple HDMI inputs. Thankfully, these are usually numbered to correspond with the inputs HDMI channel on, say your TV. Make sure you note which input you are using on the monitor. Switch to that input. For example, I have plugged my HDMI cable into my TV into the HDMI 2 input, so now I have to change the TV’s input to HDMI 2 (usually by hitting the source or input button on your remote until you hit it.</p>
<p>Plug your pi into its power source and wait for it to boot. If all goes well, you will see a rainbow image and then a ton of code running on the screen while it boots.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you see nothing and you followed the set-up, you may have to change some code in the <code>config.txt</code> file. See Raspberry Pi’s documentation for <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt.md">more information on</a> <code>config.txt</code>.</p>
<p>You should now see your pi’s desktop. Make sure you have a mouse and keyboard plugged into your pi. Explore around a bit. You can play games, use some interesting tools, etc.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure to connect to the internet. If you have purchased a Wifi dongle with your pi (it looks like a little USB stick), plug that into your pi. To connect to Wifi, select the network symbol in the top right of the screen. Select your Wifi network and enter your password.</p>
<p>Otherwise, connect your pi directly to one of your router’s (usually 4) ethernet ports with your ethernet cable.</p>
<h2 id="update-your-pi">Update your Pi</h2>
<p>Now that your pi is up and running, open your pi’s terminal (command line).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can also run your pi directly from your own computer using a secure shell or SSH. This is a very simple method to run your pi from your own computer’s command line. See Raspberry Pi’s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/">documentation on SSH</a>. This is purely preference. SSH-ing is pretty darn cool and can help if you don’t want cords running every which way out of your pi. I prefer using the pi’s terminal.</p>
<p>Although you have the latest operating system image, you will still need to upgrade your packages since many have had updates since the original operating system was written and published. To do this, you will need to run two commands integral to Linux operating systems (which pi is based off of):</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get update</code> grabs all of the packages to keep your system updated.<br>
<code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> extracts and installs the downloaded packages.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will be running these commands as the administrator or ‘superuser’ using the UNIX command <code>sudo</code>. If your pi prompts you for a password, the default password is <code>raspberry</code>.</p>
<p>You may at this point receive an error telling you that the pi has failed to fetch certain items. Simply run <code>sudo reboot</code> to restart your pi and then run <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> again.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your pi ever fails to download any program or packages, it is usually good practice to <code>sudo reboot</code> and then to re-download whatever you were trying to install. This tends to fix the problem a majority of the time.</p>
<p>The problem with <code>sudo apt-get update</code> is that it saves the packages to your system regardless of whether you have enough space or not. Remember, your pi is nowhere nearly as powerful as a laptop or desktop computer, nor does it have the same storage capacity. Everything is run on your Micro SD card (usually 4 or 8GB). You can always check your disk partition, size, and usage by typing <code>df -h</code> (view in GB) or <code>df -m</code> (view in MB) into the terminal.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will want to keep your pi clean and lean. Once your packages have upgraded successfully, run <code>sudo apt-get clean</code> to dump your apt-get cache. <strong>Be Aware</strong> that this method dumps any memory from your <code>apt-get</code> folder. You may have other downloaded items. So be sure that you are willing to dump this information and that you are not currently trying to install or download anything else using <code>sudo apt-get install</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configure-the-camera">Configure the Camera</h2>
<p>To install the camera into your pi, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/">follow Raspberry Pi’s instructional video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Be careful touching any pi components. If you have built up static electricity, you can short the electronics and ruin your pi. The easy solution is to touch a non-coated pure metal to ground yourself. While it is not hugely likely you will short your pi, especially if you are not directly touching components, it is safe practice to ground yourself. <strong>Remember</strong> you accept full responsibility if you have to replace parts.</p>
<p>To configure your camera, run <code>sudo raspi-config</code>. Using your up and down keys, scroll down to <code>Enable Camera</code> and hit enter to turn the camera on. This is also a good time to expand your SD card partition. This is optional, but it allows you to use the entire SD card to store your files. If you do not expand your partition, you may run into problems installing programs in the future. To do this, within <code>raspi config</code> scroll to <code>Expand Filesystem</code> and hit enter to partition the card. See Raspberry Pi’s <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md">official documentation</a> for more options on configuring your pi (for instance, you may want to overclock your pi to get the most power out of it).</p>
<p>Now scroll down to the bottom with your down key, hit the right side key, and then hit enter to finish to configuration. Your pi will now reboot.</p>
<p>To test if you pi camera is working, open the terminal again and type <code>raspistill -v -o test.jpg</code>. This turns the camera on, captures the image, and saves it with the specified name (i.e. in the above example, it saves it as <code>test.jpg</code>).</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your working directory in the terminal. Unless you have used the <code>cd</code> method to change directories to this point, you should still be in the main directory. you can always type <code>ls</code> into the terminal to view a list of the current directory’s files. On your desktop, navigate to the main directory with you Downloads, Desktop, Music, Pictures, etc. folders. You will see <code>test.jpg</code>. Double click it to view your new photo.</p>
<h3 id="download-the-ocr-engine">Download the OCR Engine</h3>
<p>Now that we can take photos, we will download the OCR technology to convert our photos of text to actual text files. We will be using <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>, a free open source OCR engine sponsored by Google.</p>
<p>In the terminal type <code>sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr</code>.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-sound-and-speech">Configuring Sound and Speech</h2>
<p>Next we will want to configure our pi’s sound output, text to speech, and then speech to text software.</p>
