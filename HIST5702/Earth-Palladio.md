<h2 id="google-earth">Google Earth</h2>
<p>This tutorial shows you how to create your own map using Google Earth. Maps are great methods to visualize historical information and even plot data. For this post, I want to mention a few ways to use Google Earth in conjunction with other programs. For instance, last year I created a visualization of the sounds of Carleton’s construction using <a href="http://gephi.org">Gephi</a>. I wrote about this project more <a href="http://bladesrob.com/digital-humanities/soundscapes-of-carleton-construction/">in depth on my website</a>, but essentially I followed <a href="http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/08/09/us-airlines-graph/">this method</a>. In Gephi, I uploaded a spreadsheet of data to visualize the intensity of construction sounds at certain points on Carleton’s campus. Using ExportToEarth, a Gephi plugin, I georectified my Gephi visualization. Each node was tagged with Latitudal and Longitudal data. I could now export the Gephi file as a KMZ file to be mapped onto Google Earth. Google Earth thus acted as the backdrop to my soundscape.</p>

<p>You have great data. It’s structured, tagged with meta-data. Well, you can visualize that with Palladio. Palladio has an easy to use Graphical User Interface to easily restructure your data. Palladio’s multi-dimensional representation of your data is its biggest strength. You can represent your data on a timeline, a map, a gallery, and more. Again, like everything, the visualization is only as strong as the data you put into it. And you structure your data for the specific platform that you are using. So my Google Map, though not as clean as Palladio, is meant to show something much different: the Gephi overlay is a network analysis between data points.</p>
