<h2 id="topic-modeling-with-mallet">Topic Modeling with Mallet</h2>
<p>Mallet is a great tool that reads text files and forms a specified amount of topics from those files. For the purposes of this tutorial, I converted and ran my masters thesis reflection through Mallet as <a href="https://github.com/rblades/Dev-Env/tree/master/HIST5702/Mallet-Tutorial-Assets">several text files available for you to use</a>.</p>
<p>I installed mallet in my <code>Downloads</code> folder. So I simply <code>cd downloads</code>. Then I <code>cd mallet-2.0.8RC2</code>. Not to check if I have everything working, I type <code>./bin/mallet</code>. Then I am presented with a list of commands:</p>

<p>After following the Programming Historian tutorial, I follow <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2011/11/11/topic-modeling-with-the-java-gui-gephi/">Graham’s other tutorial</a> using the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/topic-modeling-tool/">Java GUI</a> for Mallet to produce CSV files from my text files so that I could visualize my data using the network analysis tool <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>.</p>
<p>The Java GUI produced three CSV files.</p>
<p>Mallet is a great tool, though I prefered the Java GUI because it is simple for my basic purposes and it produced CSV files to use with Gephi. Yet without some sort of visualization, and if you do not have intimate knowledge with the text, I wonder if you could truly ‘distant’ read the results. Maybe I am just privileging visuality. I am beginning to think of a way I could sonify this data. You can of course easily relate the data. For instance, with my thesis, I saw that each text file corresponds to topics (to varying degrees). The Java GUI I used output several CSV files, so I just switched between Topics in Docs (which showed the top topic of each file) and Topic Words (which showed the grouping of each set of topics).</p>
<h2 id="antconc">AntConc</h2>
<p>AntConc is a little less like Mallet in that you have to have more of an idea of what you are looking for. Mallet allows you to generate topics from a text you may have never encountered. Both tools, however, are a method of ‘distant reading’ or engaging with large texts by finding patterns rather than reading them word by word.</p>
<p>To date, we’ve dealt with OCR, Regex, and cleaning dirty data. And while AntConc is a concordance software that allows you to search keywords in context, it has its advantages when dealing with dirty data. Wildcard characters in AntConc allows you to search dirty data. So say I OCRd some poorly digitized corpus and I want to find the word “cannon” but I know that for some reason, the letter ‘a’ seems to have been messed up in translation. I can type “c?nnon” to get all instances of our messed up “cannon.”</p>
<p>Lastly, we can compare our corpora. So if we have a large number of text files,</p>
