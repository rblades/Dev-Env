<p>Mallet is a great tool that reads text files and forms a specified amount of topics from those files. For the purposes of this tutorial, I converted and ran my masters thesis reflection through Mallet as <a href="https://github.com/rblades/Dev-Env/tree/master/HIST5702/Mallet-Tutorial-Assets">several text files available for you to use</a>.</p>
<p>I installed mallet in my <code>Downloads</code> folder. So I simply <code>cd downloads</code>. Then I <code>cd mallet-2.0.8RC2</code>. Not to check if I have everything working, I type <code>./bin/mallet</code>. Then I am presented with a list of commands:</p>

<p>After following the Programming Historian tutorial, I follow <a href="http://electricarchaeology.ca/2011/11/11/topic-modeling-with-the-java-gui-gephi/">Graham’s other tutorial</a> using the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/topic-modeling-tool/">Java GUI</a> for Mallet to produce CSV files from my text files so that I could visualize my data using the network analysis tool <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>.</p>
<p>Mallet is a great tool. But without some sort of visualization, and if you do not have intimate knowledge with the text, I wonder if you could truly ‘distant’ read the results. Maybe I am just privileging visuality. I am beginning to think of a way I could sonify this data. You can of course easily relate the data. For instance, with my thesis, I saw that each text file corresponds to topics (to varying degrees). The Java GUI I used output several CSV files, so I just switched between Topics in Docs (which showed the top topic of each file) and Topic Words (which showed the grouping of each set of topics).</p>
