<p>I love GitHub! It is easy to push content to it. I also love the fact that I can run a free website from your account. I currently run <a href="http://bladesrob.com">my own site</a> with <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a>. However, I also run my grad work at <a href="http://rblades.github.io">rblades.github.io</a> (with an <a href="http://rblades.github.io/open-notebook">open notebook</a> using <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>).</p>

<p>In this course I get to learn while helping others. And it isnâ€™t just easy for me because I already knew GitHub, markdown, and other programs, software, and applications coming in. (I used Markdown to write a tutorial for the <a href="https://opendatakit.org/">Open Data Kit</a> for the <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a> - <em>Still in development</em>.) For instance, I have learned how GitHub and other programs play with Windows (I use a Mac). I also learned on this site that markdown can store links in the following format:</p>
<p><code>[id tag] &lt;http://website.com&gt;</code></p>
<p>Before I was hyperlinking within text in this format:</p>
<p><code>[preview text](http://website.com)</code></p>
<p>In all, I also love using markdown, and here are the main reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easily human readable</li>
<li>It is clean and straightforard with easy styling and no tacked-on background encoding</li>
<li>It is widely supported on many websites</li>
<li>It is stripped of tags often found in html, xml, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-i-am-actually-taking-this-course">Why I am <em>actually</em> taking this course</h3>
<p>Admittedly I am taking this course to fullfill the final DH credit of my Masters. However, there is also a sentimental elements to it since the first class I took at Carleton was Digital History with Dr. Graham. I want to learn more digital tools and help others learn. I love collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-want-from-this-course">What I want from this course</h3>
<p>Not only do I want to learn new skills in this course, but I would like my fellow students to collaborate and apply these skills outside of the class for the digital humanities working group in the history department.</p>
